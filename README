Group Members:  Varsha Naik, Riya Pejawar, Rishabh Singh
Project Implementation:
This project aims to give a powerful network with higher security for the banking sector with one of the latest trending technology as blockchain and changing the way transaction takes place eliminating the third parties and instead of processing as one entire block as the traditional one with replacing them into multiple blocks chained together. Existing banking transaction used to have a third party as a middle man for every transaction, which makes transaction tedious less secure as anyone can temper the data being processed. The proposed web application improves Banking transaction using the blockchain technology with higher level of security using hash function (hash function maps arbitrary size inputs or messages to Ô¨Åxed size hash values or tags) by eliminating centralized ledger that reduces the manual work along with the transaction time.
